# Shellingo

## Description
A simple language-agnostic command line tool for course specific vocabulary practice.
(Without the constant harassment of the Duolingo owl :D)

## Building and setup
1. Clone the project
2. Use Maven to build the executable jar
```bash
mvn clean install
```
3. Copy the jar from the **target** folder to where you want to use it.
4. Create a subfolder named **questions** next to the jar.
5. Add vocabularies (see the How to section below)
6. Run the jar with:
```bash
java -jar shellingo-1.0.0.jar
```

## How to add vocabularies
> Shellingo will read all files in the **questions** directory and all its subdirectories next to the jar file.
> This allows organizing questions into separate text files and folders and moving them in and out of the **questions** 
> folder to change the practice materials. 
> Make sure not to mix languages, or if you do indicate the language in each question :)
> All the questions will be presented in a random order. Each word will be repeated until a correct solution is given.

- Create a text file and add one word/question per row and provide the expected answer, 
separated with a pipe **|** character.
- You can also add comments with the hash **#** character. These lines will be ignored during the practice.
- Both questions and answers will be formatted to remove leading, trailing and duplicate white spaces and punctuation
- Letter casing will be ignored during the practice

```

```text

```
